**Assumptions**:
- 10,000 total users
- 5% conversion to Premium (500 users)
- 1% conversion to Professional (100 users)
- 80% monthly billing, 20% annual billing

**Monthly Revenue**:
- Premium: (400 × £4.99) + (100 × £4.08) = £1,996 + £408 = **£2,404/month**
- Professional: (80 × £9.99) + (20 × £8.25) = £799 + £165 = **£964/month**
- **Total: £3,368/month** or **£40,416/year**

### Moderate Estimate (Year 2)

**Assumptions**:
- 50,000 total users
- 8% conversion to Premium (4,000 users)
- 2% conversion to Professional (1,000 users)

**Monthly Revenue**:
- Premium: (3,200 × £4.99) + (800 × £4.08) = £15,968 + £3,264 = **£19,232/month**
- Professional: (800 × £9.99) + (200 × £8.25) = £7,992 + £1,650 = **£9,642/month**
- **Total: £28,874/month** or **£346,488/year**

### Optimistic Estimate (Year 3)

**Assumptions**:
- 200,000 total users

- "Premium users were notified 30 minutes before you"

Your existing PayPal infrastructure is already in place. Add:

### Feature Flagging
Use feature flags to:

- Feature usage by tier
- Churn rate
- Lifetime value (LTV)
- Most popular upgrade triggers
- Free tier hitting limits

### Database Changes
Add to user profile:
```javascript
{
  subscriptionTier: "free" | "premium" | "professional",
  subscriptionStatus: "active" | "trial" | "cancelled" | "expired",
  dailyJobViews: 0, // reset daily for free users
  savedSearches: [],
  bookmarkedJobs: [],
  applicationTracking: {},
  preferences: {
    emailNotifications: true,
    pushNotifications: false,
    smsNotifications: false,
  }
}
```

## Success Metrics

### Launch Targets (First 6 Months)
- 5,000+ registered users
- 250+ premium subscribers (5% conversion)
- 50+ professional subscribers (1% conversion)
- £2,500+/month recurring revenue
- <5% monthly churn rate
- Average 3+ job applications per premium user per week

### Year 1 Targets

---

## Risk Mitigation

### Potential Risks
1. **Free users leave**: Make free tier valuable but limited
2. **Low conversion**: A/B test pricing, offer trials, improve value props
3. **High churn**: Focus on job placement success, add sticky features
4. **Technical debt**: Phase implementation carefully
5. **Job source changes**: Diversify sources, have backup scrapers

### Contingency Plans
- If conversion <3%: Extend free trials, adjust pricing
- If churn >7%: Survey churned users, improve features
- If costs exceed revenue: Reduce free tier further, increase prices
- If job sources fail: Have 6+ sources minimum for redundancy

## Conclusion

Next Gig has strong fundamentals for a successful freemium model:
- ✅ Unique value proposition (job aggregation + tracking)
- ✅ Clear feature differentiation between tiers
- ✅ Existing payment infrastructure
- ✅ Scalable architecture

**Recommended Path Forward**:
1. Start with **Free + Premium** two-tier model (£4.99/month)
2. Add **Professional** tier (£9.99/month) after 3-6 months
3. Continuously iterate based on user feedback and metrics
4. Target £25K+ MRR by end of Year 1

The key to success is making the free tier good enough to build a user base, while making premium compelling enough that 5-10% convert. Focus on delivering real value, and the revenue will follow.
